    "# Question 2  Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Situation: You are developing a program to manage a zoo, where various types of animals are kept in different enclosures. To streamline your code, you decide to use inheritance to model the relationships between different types of animals and their behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Explain the concept of inheritance in Java. Provide an example scenario where inheritance is useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inheritance in Java is a mechanism where a new class (subclass) is derived from an existing class (superclass). The subclass inherits attributes and methods from its superclass, allowing for code reuse and the establishment of an \"is-a\" relationship between classes. This means that a subclass is a more specialized version of its superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to implement a Java class hierarchy to represent different types of animals in the zoo. Create a superclass `Animal` with basic attributes and methods common to all animals, and at least three subclasses representing specific types of animals with additional attributes and methods. Include comments to explain your code, specifically how inheritance is used."
